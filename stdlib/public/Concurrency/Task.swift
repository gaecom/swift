// ==== Task -------------------------------------------------------------------

/// A unit of asynchronous work.
///
/// An instance of `Task` always represents a top-level task. The instance
/// can be used to await its completion, cancel the task, etc., The task will
/// run to completion even if there are no other instances of the `Task`.
///
/// `Task` also provides appropriate context-sensitive static functions which
/// operate on the "current" task, which might either be a detached task or
/// a child task. Because all such functions are `async` they can only
/// be invoked as part of an existing task, and therefore are guaranteed to be
/// effective.
///
/// Only code that's running as part of the task can interact with that task,
/// by invoking the appropriate context-sensitive static functions which operate
/// on the current task.
///
/// A task's execution can be seen as a series of periods where the task ran.
/// Each such period ends at a suspension point or the
/// completion of the task.
///
/// These partial periods towards the task's completion are `PartialAsyncTask`.
/// Unless you're implementing a scheduler,
/// you don't generally interact with partial tasks directly.
///
/// Task Cancellation
/// =================
///
/// Tasks include a shared mechanism for indicating cancellation,
/// but not a shared implementation for how to handle cancellation.
/// Depending on the work you're doing in the task,
/// the correct way to stop that work varies.
/// Likewise,
/// it's the responsibility of the code running as part of the task
/// to check for cancellation whenever stopping is appropriate.
/// In a long-task that includes multiple pieces,
/// you might need to check for cancellation at several points,
/// and handle cancellation differently at each point.
/// If you only need to throw an error to stop the work,
/// call the `Task.checkCancellation()` function to check for cancellation.
/// Other responses to cancellation include
/// returning the work completed so far, returning an empty result, or returning `nil`.
///
/// Cancellation is a purely Boolean state;
/// there's no way to include additional information
/// like the reason for cancellation.
/// This reflects the fact that a task can be canceled for many reasons,
/// and additional reasons can accrue during the cancellation process.

// ==== Task Priority ----------------------------------------------------------

/// ### Priority scheduling
/// An executor MAY utilize priority information to attempt running higher
/// priority tasks first, and then continuing to serve lower priority tasks.
///
/// The exact semantics of how priority is treated are left up to each
/// platform and `Executor` implementation.
///
/// ### Priority inheritance
/// Child tasks automatically inherit their parent task's priority.
///
/// Detached tasks (created by `Task.detached`) DO NOT inherit task priority,
/// as they are "detached" from their parent tasks after all.
///
/// ### Priority elevation
/// In some situations the priority of a task must be elevated (or "escalated", "raised"):
///
/// - if a `Task` running on behalf of an actor, and a new higher-priority
///   task is enqueued to the actor, its current task must be temporarily
///   elevated to the priority of the enqueued task, in order to allow the new
///   task to be processed at--effectively-- the priority it was enqueued with.
///   - this DOES NOT affect `Task.currentPriority()`.
/// - if a task is created with a `Task.Handle`, and a higher-priority task
///   calls the `await handle.get()` function the priority of this task must be
///   permanently increased until the task completes.
///   - this DOES affect `Task.currentPriority()`.
///
/// TODO: Define the details of task priority; It is likely to be a concept
///       similar to Darwin Dispatch's QoS; bearing in mind that priority is not as
///       much of a thing on other platforms (i.e. server side Linux systems).
